        <p align="justify"><center>
        <font size="6">My name is Ezeh Ernest. Am from Nsukka in Enugu State.
            I passed through my secondary 
            education at The Paraclete College and my primary 
            education at Equilex Nursery and Primary
             School. I am positive about every 
             aspect of life. There are many things i like to do,
            to see, and to experience. I like to read, i like to 
            write, i like to think, i like to talk and i 
                        also like to listen.
            <p>Always wanted to be a writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman 
             Roland who wrote "John Christopher".They influenced millions of people through their 
             books. I also wanted James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people's mind. Of course, 
             i am  nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some
              research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.</p> 
                 <p>This is a brief introuduction about myself. </p></font>
