        <p align="justify"><font size="6">
          My name is Ernest and this is the story of my secondary school life.
            The name of my secondary school is The Paraclete College Obukpa.I 
            entered Paraclete approximately in the year 2016. That was when i first tasted school life,
            i mean the main school not primary school child's play, i enter jss 1 B and i met agric that morning
            our agric teacher was mr Chukwuma[the man dey flock hell but i never knew] and he welcome me cheerfully
            with a smile. Shortly it was break, and my father gave me #200 to flex with and i thought i was a big boy
            because they never gave me in primary school days, and i was accompanied by one of friend from home named
            Isreal- a very bad boy but i like him sha. Then the break was over, Around 4pm the school was dismissed 
            and everyone went home.<br><br>
            Life was just going bit by bit, until we got to our BECE[junior waec] exams, when it was like two months
            head, our principal told us that we should keep on reading. He warned that whosoever that will not do well 
            in the fortcoming exam will leave the school. He also promised that the best student in that exam will
            will be given a reward by the school and also by himself. God helping me, the exam came and gone, when the 
            result came out, i checked mine and i found out that i was one those that pass the examination. Many of my 
            seth mates failed and was throwned out the school.<br><br>
            Before we knew what was happening, we got into the bigger boys class which was ss3.It seems to me that i 
            have arrived not knowing that it was just the beginning of the world. I then realized that this was the class
            where senior waec and jamb exams are beign wrote, so i stood up and started preparing for the exams on time.
            Then after all the night reading, the exam came and we wrote it. After a month or two the result came out and 
            many of us where in joy while others where in anguish.
