         <font size="6"><p align="justify">
            The class seems so intresting and amazing especially when it comes to the practical
            aspect. I do enjoy every bit of the class, i always fill happy when i code and it is reflecting 
            to the live server, then it will make the class more intresting to me. <br>
            I will not forget to thank our master who is giving us the best he has in making sure we 
           are not waisting our time here learning this course.
